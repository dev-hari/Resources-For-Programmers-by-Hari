As a data analyst, you will usually have to decide which program or solution is right for the particular project you are working on; in this reading, you will learn more about how to choose which tool you need and when. 

Depending on which phase of the data analysis process youâ€™re in, you will need to use different tools. For example, if you are focusing on creating complex and eye-catching visualizations, then the visualization tools we discussed earlier are the best choice. But if you are focusing on organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data, then you will probably be choosing between spreadsheets and databases using queries. Spreadsheets and databases both offer ways to store, manage, and use data. The basic content for both tools are sets of values. Yet, there are some key differences, too:

Spreadsheets	                                 Databases 
Software applications 	                       Data stores - accessed using a query language (e.g. SQL)
Structure data in a row and column format   	 Structure data using rules and relationships
Organize information in cells	                 Organize information in complex collections
Provide access to a limited amount of data	   Provide access to huge amounts of data
Manual data entry	                             Strict and consistent data entry
Generally one user at a time	                 Multiple users 
Controlled by the user 	                       Controlled by a database management system
